# svg-loader-challenge

![blue logo](demo/docs/logoblue.png)

Welcome! Your experience with this challenge is more important to us than the actual end result. Try to learn and have fun! This challenge can show us what knowledge you have and how you acquire new techniques.

## General direction
The white logo is currently quite plain. Jesse who runs the sales department would like to make it more interesting by using the logo as a Loading Spinner. His plan is to ask a couple of developers to create a concept. To help out he created a project on https://github.com/WHITEdevelopment/svg-loader-challenge.git.

## Getting started

We have created a very effective development environment for you. Files you need are in the ./src folder. We also added a basic svg logo to get you started. You can often find tips inside files (code comments). Do checkout the gulpfile.js as it contains info on how to make your development server even better.

-- Make sure you have nodejs installed on you machine. Installation instructions can be found on https://nodejs.org/en/. We used version 4.4.4
```
// To check installation run command
node --version
```

-- Go into your project folder and run the following command to install the development server
```
npm install
```

-- Start the development server using the following command. keep the command line window open. It runs the build process. A browser window should open.
```
gulp demo
```

## Things to check
* Keep it simple!
* Create comments on decisions that you make and why you made them in the code.
* Create comments on difficulties you had along the way in the code.
* SEO Readable text with Header logo

We aim to make this challenge a good learning experience for all our candidates. Please provide us with some feedback on how we could improve.
